File: agent_cognition/impressions.py
Description: defines how agents store interpersonal impressions and theory-of-mind of other characters. 
             This assumes that "set_impression" will be called at least once at the end of a round.
             So, in the case that this agent has already made an impression about a person, only memories from 
             the last round should be reasoned over; other memories are theoretically already encoded in the agent's 
             impressions of the target.

             However, if a player comes across a new target, all relevant memories to the target will be pulled.
